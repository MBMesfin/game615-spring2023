Display a timer on the screen. If the player fails to collect all the collectable items before it reaches zero, destroy the player and display a "You Lose" message of some sort.

Enhance the realism by making it so the plane increases in speed when facing downwards and decreases when facing upward. Hint: how much the plane is facing up or down can be determined by the y value of the forward vector.

Bugs: The collectable score is having an issue displaying, the bullet is not shooting in the right direction
